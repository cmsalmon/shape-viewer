The user should be able to open a shape file by clicking the button on the top toolbar or left menu.
   - Does this mean the button would lose its ability to select a file in favor of opening the selected shape file?


***Notes
Error handling for uploaded files
	-handle duplicate z-index (shape that came later goes on top)
	-remove any comments
	-handle invalid shapes
	-handle invalid width/length/xy points
	-invalid file type
	-maybe a warning for empty file
	-error messages

for the error messages for the shape, there is a more elegant way. store error type or something. figure it out

Find the thing that lets you reuse the same string with diff arguments that I used in IBM so I can handle error messages

***Testing
-test number boundaries
